Subject: Request for Temporary Work from Home ArrangementDear [Manager's Name],I trust this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the possibility of working remotely for the next few weeks. As I am currently on the bench and actively seeking a new project, I believe that working from home during this interim period would allow me to remain productive and contribute to the team's objectives.I understand the importance of being readily available, and I assure you that I will maintain constant communication and accessibility during work hours. Additionally, the duration of this remote work arrangement will depend on the availability of my return tickets from home, with an estimated timeframe of 3 to 4 weeks.I am committed to ensuring that all my responsibilities and deliverables are met during this period. If necessary, I am more than willing to discuss and coordinate any adjustments needed to facilitate a smooth transition.Thank you for considering my request. I am open to discussing this further at your earliest convenience.Best regards,[Your Full Name] [Your Position] [Your Contact Information]
